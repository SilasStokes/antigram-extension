# Antigram ![alt text][logo] Chrome Extension

Antigram is a chrome extension that gives the user tools to fight back Instagram's addictive
features. It was made on my free time with the objective of being able to check what were my friends
up to without falling into a blackhole of meaningless content.

##### Current features

- Explore Blocker
- Stories Blocker
- Suggestions Blocker
- Feed Blocker
- Background Color modification

##### Future features?

- Lock Settings
- Set timer
- Better feed visualization
- ... (I accept [suggestions](https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension/issues))

### Technology Used

- Javascript, HTML and plain CSS

### Setup

Download it from
[Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/antigram-explore-blocker/igbheapdmolhhmmklmkfjjjncmhihfjh "Chrome Store")
or install it manually:

### Manually Build:
1. clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension.git`
2. change directories into the repo `cd antigram-extension`
3. install the npm packages with `npm install`
4. run the build with `npm run build`
5. open chrome

12. Done!


### Warning

If it does not work, maybe it is because Instagram updated the web version and the elements to
select changed. In that case, please check if you are using the last version of Antigram, and if
that is the case, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension/issues). Thank
you

##### Sources and recommendations

This extension is mostly inspired by Jord West's
[News Feed Eradicator](https://github.com/jordwest/news-feed-eradicator), which I recommend if you
are a Facebook user. Additionally, I also recommend
[DF Youtube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna)
to have a better experience using Youtube.
